The dataset used, also known as Animal Faces-HQ (AFHQ), consists of 16,130 high-quality images at 512Ã—512 resolution.
There are three domains of classes, each providing about 5000 images. By having multiple (three) domains and diverse images of various breeds per each domain, AFHQ sets a challenging image-to-image translation problem. The classes are:
Cat;
Dog;
Wildlife.

This project is to train a deep learning model to classify animal's images into one of the three categories (Cat, Dog, Wildlife), using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
